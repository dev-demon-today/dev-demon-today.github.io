title: "Jekyll Custom Theme"

Well, installing a custom theme turned out to be an easy task. It took only 15 minutes. 
I added a couple of plugins for pagination and meta tags, added templates, a bunch of styles, run the builder and Voila. 

Jekyll works on Ruby, but I decided don't install Ruby on my machine and run builder inside a docker container. 
I chose a platform for this blog based on such parameters as ease of making 
a build and the ability to transfer development even on computers without pre-installed tools. 

Currently, only Docker and a text editor are required to build this site. 
And Git, of course. I think this is a good choice to focus on content, not development.

I'm not sure yet that this is an ideal option for me, but overall I like it.
